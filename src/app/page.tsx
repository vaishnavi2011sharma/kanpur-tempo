const FAQS = [
  { q: 'Q1. How early should I book a tempo traveller in Kanpur?', a: 'If your travel dates are fixed, do not wait till the last moment. In Kanpur, vehicles get booked quickly during wedding season and long weekends. Booking 4 to 7 days in advance is usually a safe choice if you want a good vehicle at a reasonable price.' },
  { q: 'Q2. Will the tempo traveller come to my exact pickup location in Kanpur?', a: 'Yes, in most cases the vehicle will come right to your doorstep. Whether you are near the railway station, a hotel, or any residential area in Kanpur, pickup can be arranged easily. Just share the correct location while booking.' },
  { q: 'Q3. Are there any hidden charges in tempo traveller rental in Kanpur?', a: 'This depends on the service provider. A good rental company will clearly explain everything — like toll tax, parking, and driver allowance. At Yatra Travel India it is always better to ask once before confirming so there are no surprises later.' },
  { q: 'Q4. Can I plan a multi-day or multi-city trip from Kanpur?', a: 'Yes, and honestly this is where a tempo traveller makes the most sense.

  { q: 'Q5. Is there any difference between a normal and a luxury tempo traveller?', a: 'Yes, there is a noticeable difference. A normal tempo traveller is simple and budget-friendly.
